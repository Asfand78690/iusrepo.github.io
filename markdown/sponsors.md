# Sponsors

IUS is made possible by our sponsors.

<br><br>
![Rackspace](/images/rackspace.svg){:width="200px"}

[Rackspace][rackspace] is our primary sponsor.  We utilize [Rackspace Cloud
Servers][servers], [Rackspace CDN][cdn], and [Rackspace Cloud Files][files].

<br><br>
![Fedora](/images/fedora.svg){:width="160px"}

[Fedora][fedora] doesn't directly sponsor us, but most of our spec files are
based on Fedora spec files.  Our infrastructure also runs [Fedora
Server][fedora-server].

<br><br>
![GitHub](/images/github.svg){:width="120px"}

[GitHub][github] doesn't directly sponsor us, but we host our [package
sources][spec] on GitHub.  This site is also hosted on [GitHub Pages][pages].

<br><br>
![Prospect One](/images/prospectone.png){:width="200px"}

[Prospect One][prospectone] designed our [current logo][logo] and donated it to
the project.

<br><br>
![Sticker Mule](/images/stickermule.svg){:width="240px"}

[Sticker Mule][stickermule] donated store credit to IUS so we were able to
order logo stickers.
